# PDFtoContact
Python script to read PDF reports and extract contact information for a specific work application.

# General Info

This is a basic script I created for a very specific work application.  It was designed to pull contact information from a large set of PDF reports we would receive on a periodic basis and export that information to a CSV that would be shared with Business Development.

It served its purpose and is no longer being developed or maintained.
